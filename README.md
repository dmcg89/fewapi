FileReader API pulls out the inner contents of a text file and displays them in the browser.

Instructions:

Simply select a text file to upload and see it displayed in your browser.

Potential Use:

A feature like this could be a component of Github, but obviously to make it a useful tool for code further formatting would be pretty essential.

Browser support:

FileReader API is supported by all conventional modern browsers.
